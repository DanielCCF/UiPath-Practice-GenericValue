Problem Statement: Add and Concatenate GenericValue Variables 

1. Create four variables of the GenericValue type in your sequence: 

* A with value “123” 
* B with value “456” 
* C with value 123 
* D with value 456

2. Print to the Output panel various operations with them and see what the result is: 

* A + B 
* C + D 
* A + C 
* C + A

Output: Generate one log entry in the Output panel for each calculation.  Output: Generate one log entry in the Output panel for each calculation.

= Developed Solution

The use of test cases prevented a single sequence from performing and outputting all the mentioned results. This occurred due to a combination of factors:

1. The exercise's intention is to observe the behavior of generic variables.
2. Test cases are designed to analyze code behavior in expected scenarios.
3. The expected behavior for the exercise includes a mix of four different types of operations:
.. Text + Text
.. Text + Number
.. Number + Number
.. Number + Text
4. Creating a single test case to cover all four different types of operations contradicts the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).

These factors led me to decide to create a straightforward sequence that only adds generic variables and four separate tests to encompass the operations.
